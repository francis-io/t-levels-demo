Here is a 55‑minute lesson plan for T Level Engineering (Years 1 and 2
combined group) that teaches an **8 Wastes Walk** the students can later
carry out in their SME placement as part of their 42‑day industry
placement project.resilience4dairy+3

**Lesson overview**

-   **Topic:** 8 Wastes of Lean and planning a Waste Walk

-   **Duration:** 55 minutes

-   **Class:** T Level Engineering, Year 1--2 mixed or parallel groups

-   **Context:** Pre‑placement preparation so learners can run a simple
    8‑waste walk (gemba/waste walk) in an SME factory to identify
    improvements in productivity and flow.leanconstruction+3

**Intended learning outcomes**

By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:

1.  Name and explain the **8 wastes** using the TIMWOODS (or DOWNTIME)
    acronym.6sigma+2

2.  Describe the purpose and basic ground rules of a **Waste Walk** in a
    factory.engineeringpossibilities+2

3.  Use a simple observation sheet to spot at least one example of each
    waste in a sample process.resilience4dairy+2

4.  Draft a short **waste‑reduction action plan** that could
    realistically improve productivity for an SME employer.theleanway+3

**0--5 min -- Starter: "Where does time go?"**

-   Show a simple process photo or short description (e.g. packing line,
    small machining cell, assembly bench) and ask:

    -   "Where might time or effort be wasted here?"

-   Take quick suggestions and link to Lean's aim: maximise value,
    minimise waste in production.6sigma+1

Differentiate:

-   Year 1: accept everyday examples (walking, looking for tools).

-   Year 2: push for process terms (set‑up time, rework, excess
    movement).

**5--15 min -- Input: The 8 wastes and TIMWOODS**

Teacher‑led explanation with visuals:

-   Introduce the 8 wastes using a simple acronym such as **TIMWOODS**:

    -   Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction,
        Over‑processing, Defects, Skills (unused
        talent).theknowledgeacademy+2

-   Give a **factory‑specific example** for each, e.g.:

    -   Transport: pallets moved across the site twice.

    -   Inventory: racks of WIP waiting for the next operation.

    -   Motion: operators walking to a distant tool
        cupboard.leansmarts+2

-   Briefly connect each waste to **lost productivity, longer lead
    times, higher costs** for an SME.6sigma+2

Quick check for understanding:

-   Ask students in pairs to match waste names to short descriptions or
    pictures.

Year focus:

-   Year 1: secure basic definitions with simple pictures.

-   Year 2: emphasise impact on **OEE, throughput, and customer
    delivery** in real plants.

**15--25 min -- Modelling a Waste Walk**

Explain how a **Waste Walk (gemba walk)** works:

-   Purpose: walk the process "where the work happens" to **see the 8
    wastes in real time** and talk to
    operators.engineeringpossibilities+3

-   Simple rules:

    -   Be respectful; observe quietly first, then ask questions.

    -   Focus on **process**, not blaming people.

    -   Capture facts: where, what, why, potential impact.

Introduce a **Waste Walk Observation Sheet** (adapted from
examples):resilience4dairy+1

-   Columns: Process step / Waste type / What do you see? / Idea to
    improve / Expected benefit.

-   Show a brief demo:

    -   Example: "Assembly bench -- Waiting -- Operator idle while parts
        arrive -- Idea: Kanban for parts -- Benefit: less downtime, more
        units per shift".theleanway+2

Clarify expectations for **use on placement**:

-   Each student will carry out **at least one Waste Walk** in their SME
    placement, focusing on a small area or process, and propose **3
    priority improvements** to discuss with their
    supervisor.engineeringpossibilities+2

**25--40 min -- Activity: Simulated 8 Wastes Walk (classroom exercise)**

Group activity to practise before going into a real factory.

1.  Split class into groups of 3--4.

2.  Give each group:

    -   A short narrative, layout sketch or photo set of a fictional SME
        process (e.g. packaging cell, welding bay, CNC line) with
        **deliberate wastes** built in (queues, excess walking, rework,
        etc.).

    -   A copy of the **Waste Walk Observation Sheet**.

3.  Task (about 10--12 minutes):

    -   "Imagine you are walking this area on your placement. Identify
        **at least one example of each of the 8 wastes** and note a
        practical improvement."6sigma+3

    -   For each improvement, briefly state **how it might increase
        throughput, reduce defects, or save time**.

4.  Teacher circulates:

    -   For Year 1, support spotting obvious wastes and writing simple
        ideas.

    -   For Year 2, challenge students to quantify: "How many minutes
        per shift might this save? How would that affect output?"

**40--50 min -- Plenary: From walk to productivity gains**

Whole‑class discussion to link their observations explicitly to SME
production improvement.

-   Ask 2--3 groups to share **one high‑impact waste** and their
    proposed fix.

-   As a class, discuss the impact on a small employer:

    -   Reduced **waiting and motion** = more time actually producing;
        more units per day.6sigma+2

    -   Less **over‑processing and defects** = lower scrap and rework
        costs; improved quality reputation.theleanway+2

    -   Better use of **skills** = operators involved in
        problem‑solving, more ideas for continuous improvement.6sigma+2

Capture on the board three summary statements students can re‑use in
placement reports, e.g.:

-   "By reducing waiting and motion we can increase output per operator
    hour for the SME."

-   "Targeting defects and over‑processing reduces scrap costs and
    rework, improving profit margin."6sigma+2

**50--55 min -- Exit task and placement link**

Students individually complete a short exit slip to set up their
**placement action**:

-   "In my placement I could complete a Waste Walk in the area of
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

-   "The three wastes I expect to see are \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_,
    and \_\_\_\_\_\_."

-   "One improvement I might suggest to my supervisor is \_\_\_\_\_\_,
    which should help productivity by \_\_\_\_\_\_."

For Year 2, ask them to also state **how they will gain permission and
involve staff** (e.g. speak to supervisor, agree time, share findings).

**How this supports their 42‑day placement and the SME**

During placement, each student:

1.  Negotiates with their supervisor to carry out a **short Waste Walk**
    (20--30 minutes) on a chosen process.

2.  Uses the same observation sheet to identify examples of the 8 wastes
    and capture realistic improvement ideas.resilience4dairy+3

3.  Prioritises **three improvements** with clear benefits (time saved,
    defects reduced, distance walked reduced, better use of skills).

4.  Presents these back to the supervisor (brief conversation or short
    write‑up) and, where appropriate, helps trial at least one change.

Benefits for the SME employer:

-   Fresh eyes spotting wastes that existing staff may have
    normalised.theleanway+2

-   Low‑cost improvements (layout tweaks, visual controls, better use of
    operator ideas) that can **increase throughput, shorten lead times
    and improve quality**.6sigma+2

-   Evidence that T Level students can apply Lean thinking to make
    **tangible, productivity‑focused contributions** during their 42‑day
    placement.engineeringpossibilities+3

If you tell me which specific Engineering & Manufacturing route (e.g.
Maintenance, Manufacturing, Design & Development), I can give you sample
SME scenarios and a one‑page observation sheet tailored to that route.
