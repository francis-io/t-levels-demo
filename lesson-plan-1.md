Lean manufacturing lesson plan 55 mins -- suggestion

**Year 1 (core focus -- first exposure)**

Aim: introduce Lean thinking and 5S as core "good workplace habits" and
link to general employability.

-   Keep the structure I outlined:

    -   Hook with messy desk; simple definition of Lean and waste.

    -   Clear, visual explanation of each S with everyday examples.

    -   Short paper or simple "messy toolbox" 5S game to feel the
        benefit.

    -   Group task: apply 5S ideas to a classroom/workshop area and
        capture actions on a worksheet.

    -   Plenary: quick quiz to name the 5Ss and one action for each;
        exit ticket on "where I'll use this".

-   Emphasis:

    -   Vocabulary (waste, value, flow, 5S terms).

    -   Safe, organised behaviour in any workplace.

    -   Basic observation and reflection skills (spotting waste,
        suggesting improvements).

**Year 2 (occupational specialism -- deeper application)**

Aim: move from awareness to using 5S as a technical tool in their
specialism and on placement.

You can run a **parallel 55‑minute lesson** with more advanced tasks:

1.  **Recap (5 mins)**

    -   Quick challenge: in pairs, reconstruct the 5Ss and give one
        manufacturing‑specific example each.

    -   Link explicitly to T Level expectations and industry placement
        standards.

2.  **Input -- 5S as part of Lean system (10 mins)**

    -   Show how 5S underpins safety, quality, cost, delivery and morale
        in real engineering settings.

    -   Use a short case vignette of a workshop or production cell
        (could be from an employer, local photo, or a simple layout
        sketch).

    -   Introduce basic Lean measures they'll meet in industry (e.g.
        changeover time, search time, defect rates) and how 5S affects
        them.

3.  **Activity -- 5S improvement proposal (25 mins)**

    -   Give each group a realistic scenario: layout of a CNC bay,
        maintenance store, assembly bench, etc., with deliberate "waste"
        baked in.

    -   Task:

        -   Perform a rapid 5S audit (what's wrong, where is waste, what
            are the risks?).

        -   Design a 5S improvement plan: for each S, specify actions,
            responsibilities, simple standards (shadow boards, floor
            marking, visual controls, checklists) and how they would
            measure improvement.

    -   Stretch: ask them to sketch a simple before/after layout or
        visual standard (e.g. labelled rack, colour‑coded zones).

4.  **Plenary -- link to placement and assessment (15 mins)**

    -   Each group presents their highest‑impact 5S change in 60--90
        seconds.

    -   Class discusses: "Which ideas are low‑cost/high‑impact enough to
        take into a real placement?"

    -   Students write a short reflection paragraph they could later
        reuse as portfolio evidence:

        -   "Describe how you used 5S to improve
            safety/efficiency/quality in a workplace or simulated
            workplace."

**Progression across the two years**

-   **Year 1:** 5S as language and habit; mostly classroom/workshop
    based, low stakes.

-   **Year 2:** 5S as part of professional performance; explicitly tied
    to occupational specialism tasks, project work and industry
    placement behaviours.
